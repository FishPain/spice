# spice

A website that will scrape the news page of various gov agencies once a day. 

The scraped content will be passed through a LLM to determine:
•⁠  ⁠relevance (can sit spice partner with them?)
•⁠  ⁠⁠target company (any companies that they licensed to, or is it an inter gov agency effort)
•⁠  ⁠⁠opportunity (what are the problems identified through the article and how spice can come into play.)
•⁠  ⁠⁠retrieve company events (if any)
•⁠  ⁠⁠auto email drafting (auto draft cold email to be sent - requires manual sending)
