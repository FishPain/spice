       "  'body': 'Singapore, 31 July 2024 – The National Environment Agency (NEA) has issued a licence to Beverage Container Return Scheme Ltd. (BCRS Ltd.) on 29 July 2024 to design and operate the beverage container return scheme (“Scheme”) in Singapore. BCRS Ltd. was formed by beverage producers who had registered their interest to apply for a licence to operate the Scheme in May 2023. As the licensed operator, BCRS Ltd. will be responsible for collecting plastic and metal beverage containers for recycling on behalf of all beverage producers in Singapore for a period of seven years, from 1 April 2026 to 31 March 2033. The Scheme will be launched on 1 April 2026, instead of the earlier communicated date of 1 April 2025, at the request of the beverage producers to allow BCRS Ltd., beverage producers, and retailers more time to design and operationalise the Scheme smoothly with greater convenience for consumers.\\xa0Role of the Scheme Operator 2\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 BCRS Ltd. is a not-for-profit company, newly incorporated by a consortium of beverage producers comprising Coca-Cola Singapore Beverages Pte. Ltd., F&N Foods Pte. Ltd., and Pokka Pte. Ltd. to collect, sort and recycle beverage containers. 3\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Under the Scheme, pre-packaged beverages in plastic and metal containers ranging from 150 millilitres to 3 litres will have a 10-cent refundable deposit applied to them. Consumers can identify beverage products covered under the Scheme through a deposit mark labelled on the containers. Consumers can claim a full refund of the deposit when they return empty beverage containers at designated return points, including reverse vending machines. 4\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 All producers that import or manufacture covered beverage products must participate in the Scheme. BCRS Ltd. will act on behalf of all beverage producers. As required by law, BCRS Ltd. will appoint at least two Board Directors to represent the interests of smaller beverage producers.5\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The licence validity period is from 29 July 2024 to 31 March 2033, which takes into account approximately 20 months of preparatory period and seven years of operations from 1 April 2026 to 31 March 2033. This takes into account the depreciation period of key infrastructure such as reverse vending machines (estimated at about seven years). Leading up to the launch of the Scheme, BCRS Ltd. has to ensure that the return points are set up for consumers to return their empty beverage containers. It will oversee end-to-end management of the returned beverage containers and ensure that the fees for stakeholders involved in the Scheme will be fair, transparent and equitable. It will provide the start-up capital to initiate the Scheme operations and maintain sufficient reserves to cover the operation of the Scheme under all circumstances. BCRS Ltd. will need to maintain data protection systems to protect against data loss, unauthorised access, modification, disclosure, and misuse.6\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 NEA will work closely with BCRS Ltd. to organise outreach programmes to raise awareness among the public and industry about the Scheme, and to promote a culture of recycling. A website will be launched with information for the public and businesses, such as return point locations and educational and promotional events.Beverage Container Return Scheme will commence on 1 April 20267\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The launch date of the Scheme has been revised from 1 April 2025 to 1 April 2026, at the request of the consortium of beverage producers. This revision is to provide sufficient time for BCRS Ltd., beverage producers, and retailers to design and operationalise the Scheme smoothly for the convenience of consumers. Since the Expression of Interest called by NEA in April 2023, the Consortium took more time than anticipated to submit a proposal that addressed its various operational and business considerations. The Consortium formed BCRS Ltd. on 28 June 2024 and has committed to abide by all the prescribed conditions and to launch the Scheme on 1 April 2026.8\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 By the full implementation date on 1 July 2026, all beverage containers must be labelled with the deposit mark and carry a 10-cent deposit. There will be a transition period between 1 April 2026 and 30 June 2026 for the beverage and retail industry to clear older stocks which are ineligible for refunds.Convenient return point network for the public9\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 When the Scheme commences on 1 April 2026, consumers will be able to claim a full refund of the deposit when they return empty beverage containers at designated return points. BCRS Ltd. is setting up a network of more than 1,000 conveniently placed return points to achieve the target return rate of 80 per cent from the third year of the Scheme.About the Beverage Container Return Scheme10\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The Scheme adopts an Extended Producer Responsibility approach to manage packaging waste in Singapore. Beverage producers that manufacture or import pre-packaged beverages in plastic and metal containers will be made responsible for the collection and end-of-life management of the products that they put on the market. The Scheme aims to increase the recycling rate of beverage containers, thus diverting recyclable material away from waste incineration and landfill. The Scheme will also foster a culture of recycling among Singaporeans and raise consumer awareness on the importance of recycling (Refer to Annex A for an infographic on how the Scheme works).11\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 For more information on the Scheme, please visit https://www.nea.gov.sg/our-services/waste-management/beverage-container-return-scheme.~~ End ~~For more information, please submit your enquiries electronically via the\\xa0Online Feedback Form\\xa0or\\xa0myENV\\xa0mobile application.\\xa0Annex A\\xa0'},\n",
